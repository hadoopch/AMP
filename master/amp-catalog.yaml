  - title: Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection
    label: anomaly-detection
    short_description: Apply modern, deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify network intrusions.
    long_description: >-
      This project includes implementations of several neural networks
      (Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder, Bidirectional GAN, Sequence Models)
      applied to the task of anomaly detection in Tensorflow 2.0. For comparison,
      it includes two baselines (One Class SVM, PCA) and provides a frontend
      interface for exploring model results.
